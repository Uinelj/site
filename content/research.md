Here are the two research papers I've had the privilege of co-authoring:

## Ungoliant: An optimized pipeline for the generation of a very large-scale multilingual web corpus (2021)

[pdf](https://ids-pub.bsz-bw.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/10468/file/Abadji_Suarez_Romary_Ungoliant_2021.pdf)

[[OSCAR]] had a Go pipeline that got you raw, text for a plethora of languages from the web.
This paper outlines a better pipeline architecture and the addition of some metadata in a backward-compatible format,
and documents a new dataset based on a more modern [CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) dump.

## Towards a cleaner document-oriented multilingual crawled corpus (2022)

[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.463.pdf)

This one iterates over the previous paper, adding more metadata and trying to keep documents intact.
IMHO it's a better paper overall since I had more time to analyze the generated dataset.
