title: Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm *Julien "uj" Abadji*, currently working at [poolside.ai](https://poolside.ai),
building data pipelines and high quality datasets.

I especially like working at the blurry frontier of [[research]] and engineering,
trying to help put research results in production or be a helping hand on engineering efforts for research people.

When I'm not working, I'm either semi-implementing [[Projects/]] that I let sit in a private git repo
for a few years then forget, riding my [[bike]], doing some [[music]], watching [[movies]] or playing [[video games]].
I'd like to get back at photography someday...
