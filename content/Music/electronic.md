I have been a ðŸ˜Žbedroom DJ and producerðŸ˜Ž for a long time now, so surely I have tons of stuff released everywhere, right?
Funnily enough the only finished songs I have are finished because we had to ship a game with a soundtrack while making gamejams (see [[ld43]]).

# Video Game Music

All games are accessible through my itch.io: [ujj.itch.io](https://ujj.itch.io).

## [[The Questiest Quest of the Intertwined Feast]]

First game jam for me, it was really hectic. TQQOTIF being a rhythm game I had to do something okay so I spent a lot of time fighting with FL Studio/Ableton and some famitracker-like software trying to get a nice chiptune sound. Those songs are probably not great (esp. the "high def" ones where I just switched the instruments for the newgame+) but they have a special place in my heart. NoodleCup is a banger I don't wanna hear anything.

## [[my relationship with a cube]]

More emotional, story-driven game (specialty of [[People/Stending]]). I sometimes listen to the BGM when coding or focusing. Has a little nostalgic/melancholic ring to it.

## [[reminiscence]]

Game has a CW on memory-loss-related illnesses.
Simpler, more to-the-point (perhaps a bit too on the nose) soundtrack that I don't have anymore. I should ask [[People/Stending]] and put it somewhere to be able to listen to it easily.

## [[somnus]]

Thing of the game was to go through multiple locations, each location being an emotion, so I tried to represent them in each song. I'm not sure the end result is great, but I enjoyed the process, trying to go with simple songs and rely on effects to build the textures I wanted.
