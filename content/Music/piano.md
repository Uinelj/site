I've been playing piano for a lot of years now, mostly classical but i had a lot of hiatus.
Some of the pieces I have played throughout the years:

- [Doctor Gradus Ad Parnassum, Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DsqghqJwlU)
- [Prelude No. 12 from the WTC Book 1 BWV 857, J-S. Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77mBaWOOh0)
- [Les Cyclopes, Rameau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLmbZJAjeoI)
- [Menuet sur le nom d'Haydn, Ravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCXafUomRN4)
- [Prélude 1: La Colombe, Messiaen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdaT3qr7NsI)
- [Prélude 7: Plainte Calme, Messiaen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn_BCLA_o1M)
- [Piano Sonata No. 12 in F Major, K 332 (1st movement), Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_owDX5WOE)


I'd like to explore more baroque ([Scarlatti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-Z1Q1HJwU), [Händel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBAeHDlU1E)) and more contemporary ([Rautavaara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTfFrOdB5tY), [Ligeti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXsRlMneOS0)) composers.

## Now (as of Oct '24)

I want to play more pieces per year, and also more diverse pieces, even if it means drastically diminishing the (apparent) complexity.
In a way the upper complexity limit is nearly infinite, since you have so many things you can improve sound wise.

Right now I have started some easy pieces to get back at it, and I'll ramp up afterwards:

- [Minuet in G Major, Pezold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbN7KezIuWo)
- [Ester Verlust Op. 68 No. 16, Schumann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpbDKmXVKnY)
