I'm currently working at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/)'s [ALMAnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr) team, on [OSCAR](https://oscar-corpus.com) as a R&D Engineer! I'm very happy to be working on open-source initiatives, in one of my favourite domains, using one of my favourite languages ðŸ‘€.

I recently published my [first paper](https://ids-pub.bsz-bw.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/10468/file/Abadji_Suarez_Romary_Ungoliant_2021.pdf) about [Ungoliant](https://github.com/oscar-corpus/Ungoliant) and I'm thrilled to continue working on the project, improving both code quality and performance. I also timidly submitted small PRs in two Rust projects, and am eager to begin contributing more largely to OSS.

In the last months I've been working on personal projects too, notably:

- [[videoclub]], a movie ranking site with a _unique_ take on ranking. Backend is done in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), but the whole project is nothing much than a UI POC. I recently shut down the droplet where videoclub was running. While I may continue working on videoclub someday, it won't be before some months.

I'm currently working on other things that I'll keep under wraps for now.

Hobbies-wise, I'm still biking every now and then, since my bike is my primary way of transportation. I currently ride a [Triban RC520 Gravel](https://support.decathlon.fr/triban-rc520-gravel-2020) and a beaten down 6KU fixed gear bicycle that I'm looking to replace. I also got back to doing photography. I'm tweeting my photographs on the Twitter account [ujphoto](https://twitter.com/ujphoto). I'm currently using a [Nikon D3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3000) and a [Pentax Q-S1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_Q-S1).
